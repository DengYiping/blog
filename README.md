# Blog

This is a simple blog written in `React`. You can change the files in the public folder to use it. In general, it is quite easy to use. With little modification, you can even hook it up to a actual backend server. 

### Writing a Blog

Just simple change `1.json` (replace `1` with your blog post id you are expecting). Also, you need to change the recent blog page so that the recent changes will show up in the frontpage.


**Note**: Don't forget to escape the markdown. Without doing so, you will mess up the whole markdown rendering.

### TODO
 - [ ] add a script to generate the necessary json file based on markdown
 - [ ] write a backend server that hook up to a database
 - [ ] write a application to update the blog
